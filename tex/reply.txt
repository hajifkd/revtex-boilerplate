We would like to thank the referee very much for careful reading and helpful comments on our paper.
We have made the following changes in response to the referee's comment.

We agree that generally speaking, the superradiance instability time scale may be different from that in the linear regime when the non-linearity is important.
However, as we had noted in the paragraph in Sec. II A after the enumeration, the change of the spectrum is included as the change of the effective mass as the first order approximation. In this analysis, we found that when the effective mass changes by O(1), the particle production process by the non-linear effect is already effective. Thus, it is a reasonable approximation to use the instability scale in the linear regime to estimate the non-linear effect. The numerical simulations, Yoshino et al [12] and Yoshino et al [17], are also consistent with this observation.

We now have added some sentence to discuss this point and clarify why using the instability time scale in the linear regime is justified in the paragraph in Sec. II A after the enumeration.

We appreciate the referee for letting us know our citation was incomplete. We added references according to the comment.

Yes, this was a typo. We thank the referee for pointing it out. We fixed it.

This formula is obtained by integrating the $\phi$ flux at the infinity using the Green's function method for the Klein-Gordon equation with the massless approximation. We added Appendix B for derivation of this result.
Also, our calculation agrees with one in Arvanitaki et al 10. We mentioned it in Appendix B.

Yes, that was a typo. We fixed it.

We thank the referee for pointing out previous works on the nonlinear effect which have overlaps with our present study. We have added footnote 7 in Section III B to mention these works. 


With these modifications, we hope that we have answered the referee's concerns and our manuscript is publishable.
